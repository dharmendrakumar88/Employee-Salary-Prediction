# 💼 Internship Project Report

## 🌟 Project Title  
**Employee Salary Prediction System**

---

## 🎓 Internship Details  
- **Internship Program**: IBM SkillsBuild Virtual Internship  
- **Supported by**: Edunet Foundation  
- **Platform**: IBM SkillsBuild  
- **Duration**: 6 Weeks (June 18, 2025 – July 30, 2025)  
- **Domain**: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- **Intern**: Dharmendra Kumar

## ⚡ What I Built  
An end-to-end Streamlit-based ML application featuring:

- 🔍 Real-time salary prediction using multiple ML models  
- 🧼 Complete data preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
- 📈 Model evaluation: R², RMSE, MAE, CV scores  
- 🗓 Trend analysis based on date/time features  
- 📊 Box plots, Violin plots, Outlier detection  
- 🧪 Statistical testing (T-tests, correlation heatmaps)  
- 📅 PDF report generation with predicted results  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used  
- GradientBoosting Model  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- GridSearchCV (for model tuning)  
- K-Fold Cross Validation (for robustness)  

---
